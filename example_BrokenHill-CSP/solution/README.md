# Assignment: Poster for Broken Hill

## 1, Requirements

In the poster challenge, the main goal is to define and visualize a future scenario proposing a more desirable future for your reference case with respect to the selected key criteria.

visualize and present your future scenario and quantify
differences in relevant indicators compared to the reference case. When developing the scenario, you also fix the scale and temporal scope of your scenario.

Visualize potential (scaled) societal benefits of your scenario
compared to the reference case:
- Highlight the most dominating changes
- Exemplify differences in relevant (impact) indicators
- Relate to a sustainable development framework
- Don’t try to include everything
- A poster should be self-explanatory

Calculations for CSP - the amount of power that can be produced and how much time do we need to produce an implant f this size

## Part 1

Task 1: Implement the comments from the pitch into your study description. This may mean that you e.g. make smaller changes to the system boundaries or the proposed ideas, that you select new impact indicators to focus on or even that you decide to start all over.

Guiding questions part 1:

1. What is a clear definition of your geographical area
2. What is a clear definition of the system you are examining in the reference case as well as the solution you are proposing in your scenario
3. What is the proposed time perspective of your scenario? Could the scenario become even more sustainable if the time of implementation was postponed?

## Part 2

Task 2: Make a more detailed investigation into the situation as it is today in your reference case. Analyse the status of your system of interest. Include a description of the historical development of at least five different kinds of important impact indicators relevant for the study and the geographical area. These indicators may be intensive as well as extensive and can include e.g. kg CO2-eq/year, TOE/$, kg P per capita, t steel/MW, m3 H2O/hour and many others. Use this to identify critical sustainability issues, assets and technologies you have available, and opportunities for change.


Task 3: Develop your scenario: Envision a desirable future for the chosen study area and system. Focus especially on the investigated impact indicators, but try to address a broader range of potential positive effects. Describe the sustainable vision in accordance with selected sustainability principles and limited by local as well as global resources (energy, raw materials and people) but not by e.g. political restrictions. Quantify the scenario compared to the reference case and address influence on the assessed impact indicators. In this task it may be beneficial to use (or be inspired from) established backcasting methods within development of sustainable frameworks e.g. the UN global goals action plan, the Natural Step and the ABCD process or the Wayfinder (see Module 8 slides).

4. What are the main strengths of your proposed scenario compared to the reference case?
5. What are the main weaknesses of your proposed scenario compared to the reference case?
6. What indicators will you focus on when quantifying the benefits of your scenario compared to the current reference? Energy metrics? Greenhouse gas emissions? Depletion of limited resources? Health related issues (e.g. Toxicity indicators)? Something else?
7. How does the selection of impact indicators you are focusing on, correspond to the sustainable development you are aiming to achieve?
8. Which improvements would it not be possible to quantify the effect of – and why. Can you qualitatively characterize these improvements?

## Part 3

Task 4: Develop a plan for how the reference case can be developed into your desirable future scenario. Determine (qualitatively) how this development contributes to a more sustainable society in your area. Which aspects of sustainable development does it influence? Evaluate the gap between today and the vision and use the conclusions from e.g. a SWOT analysis to identify actions/initiatives/investments that could be relevant for you as engineers to move your system in the study area towards your vision. Imagine and develop at least four initiatives/actions to implement to facilitate your plan for a sustainable development. Explain:

- How each action moves the development in the right direction towards the vision. Does it contribute to dematerialization or substitution?
- How each action is a stepping stone towards the vision and flexible such that it does not lead to a dead end
- How each action may support further sustainable development with an adequate return on investment (environmentally, socially and economically)

9. What barriers could you imagine that there would be towards development and implementation of your scenario? Economical? Technical? Political? Cultural? Social?
10. Have you considered scale, quantity and quality of your main resources? how much is there? Is it seasonal? Is it practical to utilize/collect? Can it be efficiently sorted/divided/lightly upgraded into more valuable fractions?
11. Is there a match between your solution and the current infrastructure? Does your solution require a lot of additional infrastructure? Does this influence the temporal scope of the scenario?
12. Which negative and/positive consequences (burden-lifting >< burden-shifting) does your solution provide in other sectors? Other areas? Other countries? To future generations?

## Part 4

Task 5: Prepare a poster (A0) with visualization of the sustainable development you have designed for your area, showing changes between the reference case and the future scenario. The poster should be self- explanatory, i.e. to be understood without a presenter. The poster should include Tables, Figures, and only little text. When designing the poster, you should use your creativity to give the viewer an impression, which he/she will remember.

File type is power point or pdf. Remember to define the poster size in the setup. If possible, make the pdf file with the option “Press Quality” if using Acrobat Pro (check carefully that you get the result that you expect). The poster will be uploaded on ‘Assignments’ under ‘Poster’ with the name ‘Team xx poster’ and all Team members are to accept the content on DTU Inside. We will print the poster for you.

Task 6: Present the poster at a 28870 student poster conference on the 13st of November. There will be approximately 15 minutes available for presentation of each poster incl. questions and feedback.

- Presentation of the poster should take 8 minutes
- Posters are presented in small groups of students and teachers
- Everyone has to present the poster once
