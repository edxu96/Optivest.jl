> As the proportion of wind and solar generation capacity increases, their intermittency and stochasticity increase the need for resources able to compensate rapidly for substantial changes in the load/generation balance. Ensuring that enough generation capacity is available to meet reliably the peak demand is no longer sufficient. Generators and other resources (such as demand response and storage) must be sufficiently flexible to respond to these changes. Flexible generating units have large ramp-up and ramp- down rates, low minimum stable generation as well as short minimum up- and down­ times. Storage typically has a fast response time but must have a large enough energy capacity to sustain this response. Demand-side resources must demonstrate their dependability. [1]

> Taking the need for flexibility into account when assessing whether a portfolio of generation and other resources will meet future needs for electricity cannot be done on the basis of a projected load-duration curve because such curves do not reflect the time-domain variations of the load. To ensure that a set of resources will be able to meet a system’s operating constraints, their operation must be simulated on a set of demand profiles that reflect a sufficiently wide range of anticipated system conditions. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Ma et al. (2013) or Ulbig and Andersson (2015). [1]
