> Allocative and productive efficiency are short-run efficiency concepts, relating to the efficient use of the existing stock of assets. Allocative efficiency refers to ensuring that the goods and services produced are allocated to those who value them most highly. Productive efficiency refers to ensuring that goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost. In contrast, dynamic efficiency is a longer-run concept, relating to changes in the existing stock of assets. Dynamic efficiency refers to efficient decisions regarding investment in new assets (what, where, when, and what type of investment), including investment in developing new products and services over time.
