Bridge the gap between the long-term investment decisions about the plants to be built and the short-term operational decisions regarding the production schedule.

## 1, Introduction

> Allocative and productive efficiency are short-run efficiency concepts, relating to the efficient use of the existing stock of assets. Allocative efficiency refers to ensuring that the goods and services produced are allocated to those who value them most highly. Productive efficiency refers to ensuring that goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost. In contrast, dynamic efficiency is a longer-run concept, relating to changes in the existing stock of assets. Dynamic efficiency refers to efficient decisions regarding investment in new assets (what, where, when, and what type of investment), including investment in developing new products and services over time. [1]

## 2, Optimal Production Investment Problem

> The problem of optimal generation investment is a problem of choosing the right amount of investment, of the right type, in the right location, at the right time. [1]

## 3, Scenario of Inter-Dependent Multiple Stochastic Process from Historical Data

> In the day-ahead market, the wind forecast is simulated based on the realization of WG and the simulation of wind forecast error. The realization of WG is assumed to be the same as historical data. Wind forecast error is simulated based on a probability distribution considering the associated temporal correlation. Demand forecast is also simulated using this approach. [2]

## 4, Two Extreme Conditions

- Static trading policy learnt from historical data.
- Dynamic programming of trading process with perfect information.

## 5, Relevant Concepts

* Statistical next-stage value
	- Value of water in reservoir
