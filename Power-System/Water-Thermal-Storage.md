# Water Thermal Storage

Three vertical cylindrical hot water tanks with inner height/inner diameter ratios of 2 and water volumes of 100 l, 200 l and 300 l are made of normal steel St 37-2. The tank wall thickness of the tanks is 3 mm. The tanks are insulated with 40 mm PUR foam with a thermal conductivity of 0.034 W/mK.

1. Calculate the heat storage capacity of the hot water tanks.

2. Calculate the theoretical heat loss coefficients of the hot water tanks.
Assume a uniform tank temperature of 90°C and an ambient air temperature of 20°C.

3. What are the heat losses of the tanks in this situation?

4. What are the tank temperatures for the three tanks after a 12 h stand by period without charge and discharge of the tank, assuming that there is no thermal stratification in the tanks?

5. What are the heat losses for the three tanks during the 12 h period?
It is assumed, that the heat of the tanks is useful as long as the water temperature is higher than $50^{\circ}$C.

6. How large a part of the useful heat of the three tanks are lost during the 12 h stand by period.
