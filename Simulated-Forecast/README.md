# Simulated Forecast

## 1, Introduction

> In the day-ahead market, the wind forecast is simulated based on the realization of WG and the simulation of wind forecast error. The realization of WG is assumed to be the same as historical data. Wind forecast error is simulated based on a probability distribution considering the associated temporal correlation. Demand forecast is also simulated using this approach. [1]
