# Project for Energy and Sustainability

## 1, Introduction

In the whole project, you will select a geographical study area and develop a scenario and a plan for substantial improvements to the energy system and/or related sectors within this area. In addition, you will make a simplified sustainability assessment to determine how your proposed improvements may influence the sustainability of the assessed system.

The overall structure of the assignment:

1. Select a geographical area and a system for production of products or services within this area that you want to work with. This is called your reference case (see below).
2. Develop ideas for improvement of your reference case in a more sustainable direction
3. Present your reference case and your ideas in a Pitch competition
4. Based on your ideas and feedback from the pitch you should develop a future scenario for your system. You may use established methodologies for development of sustainable frameworks, or your own innovation processes. Make sure to relate your development to sustainability principles.
5. Compare your reference case and the scenario quantitatively and by means of indicators and present the work on a poster at a student poster conference.
6. Quantify potential improvements and possible drawbacks of your scenario compared to the reference case using simplified sustainability assessments in a life cycle perspective.
7. Present the results in a technical paper.

__Reference case__ is how your investigated area and system looks today. The reference case is limited by various system boundaries, including geographical boundaries and system functions. A reference case can be e.g. “Tomato production in Tarragona 2018” or “Private heating of apartment buildings in east Berlin 2017”

- Electricity generation in NSW 2019

__Solution__

- CSP power generation and storage in Broken Hill

__Scenario__ is a future version of the system described in the reference case. The scenario should be more sustainable than the reference case and should describe the most desirable future for this system that you can think of. The temporal scope of the scenario is an important parameter and should be included as an essential part of the study. For example, a scenario could be “Sustainable tomato production in Tarragona 2035”, “Private heating of apartment buildings in east Berlin 2050 using sustainable energy sources”, etc.

- Electricity generation in NSW in 2030

## 2, Solution: CSP power generation and storage in Broken Hill

### 2.1, Principles of CSP - How it will work

PE Foam with lots of bubble inside.

leca-stone

Direct storage

Floating insulation layer: The cover boards are floating on the surface.

Construct a dam using the soil taken from the pit.

It requires a lot of water, but we don't need water in this project.

Use the existing heavy vehicles and facilities.

reduce the vortex of water flowing in and out.

The inlet and outlet flows have a huge impact.

## 3, Simulation of Operation

### 3.1, Energy Consumption and Price

The main advantage of solar thermal generation is that the peak hours of generation and consumption are highly correlated and matched. The thermal inertia is high, so the short-term fluctuations can be mitigated. Besides, the large-scale storage facility can be used for daily thermal storage.

- Average solar source
- factors showing the move of the sun

### 3.3, Daily Long-Term Storage

static strategy without prediction

based on static calculation of

sell + store

store the heat for use during night, and generate equally during night.

## 4, Static Control Policy and Statistics

decision variables: generation size, and storage size, charging ratio

### 4.1, Simulation Result as Timeline

1. 20 years plot showing the benefits

2. carbon emission trade

### 4.2, Training Set and Validation Set
