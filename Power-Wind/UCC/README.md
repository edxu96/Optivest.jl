> This section presents a method to determine the set of generating units that provides optimally the flexibility required to accommodate a given wind penetration. Such an optimization must bridge the gap between the long-term investment decisions about the plants to be built and the short- term operational decisions of how these plants are scheduled. This is achieved in this work by introducing a new optimization algorithm, called the Unit Construction and Commitment (UCC). This algorithm is based on the unit commitment (UC) algorithm which enforces the flexibility constraints, such as ramping rate, minimum stable generation and minimum up/down time. This optimization thus determines whether a plant should be built to provide additional flexibility at a reasonable cost. [1]
