## 1, Simulation of System Operation

### 5.1, Energy Consumption and Price

The main advantage of solar thermal generation is that the peak hours of generation and consumption are highly correlated and matched. The thermal inertia is high, so the short-term fluctuations can be mitigated. Besides, the large-scale storage facility can be used for daily thermal storage.

Assume to be price taker

### 5.2, Solar Radiation

- Average solar source
- factors showing the move of the sun

### 5.3, Daily Long-Term Storage

static strategy without prediction

based on static calculation of

sell + store

store the heat for use during night, and generate equally during night.

## 4, Static Control Policy and Statistics

decision variables: generation size, and storage size, charging ratio

### 4.1, Simulation Result as Timeline

1. 20 years plot showing the benefits

2. carbon emission trade

### 4.2, Training Set and Validation Set
